# finalProject

This is my final project that I presented during demo day. This is a full stack app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS, MongoDB, and more.
In this project users are able to make a account and go into their home page. After that they have option to recent mangas, right now 
only 4 are avalibe with one page having animation as soon as you see it or when you click on the box's. On one page I added a face tracker
where when the user moves their head up, down, left or right will shoot out a animation. 

I have a live demo of it on heroku 

Thanks for look at my code.
